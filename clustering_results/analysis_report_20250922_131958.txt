CodeBERT-based Plagiarism Detection Analysis Report
==================================================

Analysis Date: 2025-09-22 13:19:58
Dataset: 1000 code submissions
Model: neulab/codebert-cpp
Clustering: DBSCAN (eps=2.5, min_samples=2)

RESULTS SUMMARY:
- Total clusters identified: 34
- Noise points: 18
- Silhouette Score: 0.5202
- Potentially plagiarized groups: 18

TOP SUSPICIOUS CLUSTERS:
- Cluster 1: 314 submissions from 311 students (HIGH risk)
- Cluster 3: 287 submissions from 238 students (HIGH risk)
- Cluster 6: 204 submissions from 204 students (HIGH risk)
- Cluster 2: 31 submissions from 31 students (HIGH risk)
- Cluster 5: 18 submissions from 18 students (HIGH risk)
- Cluster 0: 16 submissions from 16 students (HIGH risk)
- Cluster 7: 14 submissions from 14 students (HIGH risk)
- Cluster 20: 12 submissions from 12 students (HIGH risk)
- Cluster 8: 11 submissions from 11 students (HIGH risk)
- Cluster 21: 8 submissions from 8 students (MEDIUM risk)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review all clusters marked as 'HIGH' risk
2. Cross-check submission timestamps for temporal patterns
3. Manually inspect code similarity within large clusters
4. Consider academic integrity investigation for clusters with multiple submissions from few students
